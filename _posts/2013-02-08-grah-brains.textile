*Dear Internet*, (latest ever) **HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!** In honour of the slowness of my new year blog post, here is a new song:

<iframe width="400" height="100" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 100%; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1126527024/size=venti/bgcol=f5f5f5/linkcol=005580/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"><a href="http://danplusadd.bandcamp.com/track/my-brain-is-yours-acoustic">My Brain is Yours (acoustic) by Dan Plus Add</a></iframe>

Seriously, I'm extra proud of this song because of the record quality. I bought some monitor speakers and they've helped a *lot*. Please, let me know and download/share/tweet/whatever the crap out this bad boy. It took a "long time":https://twitter.com/DanPlusAdd/status/299977961942179840 to record. Oh, and "please pay some money for it": if you feel like being a super friend. You can pay what you like!

Yours undeadly,
Dan Plus Add
