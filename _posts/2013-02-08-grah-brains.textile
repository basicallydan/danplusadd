*Dear Internet*, (latest ever) **HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!** In honour of the slowness of my new year blog post, here is a new song:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78431692"></iframe>

Seriously, I'm extra proud of this song because of the record quality. I bought some monitor speakers and they've helped a *lot*. Please, let me know and download/share/tweet/whatever the crap out this bad boy. It took a "long time":https://twitter.com/DanPlusAdd/status/299977961942179840 to record.

Yours undeadly,
Dan Plus Add
