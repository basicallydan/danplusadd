<p><strong>Dear Internet</strong>, Some years ago, I started writing music under the name <strong>Dan Plus Add</strong>. Many asked questions such as &#8220;Who the hell is Ad?&#8221; or &#8220;Where do you find your inspiration?&#8221; or (a personal favourite of mine) &#8220;Why are you crashing my wedding with your beaten-up acoustic guitar and an empty box of Oreo cookies filled with poorly-labelled CDs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Internet, I look back on those years fondly. I somehow managed to write two full albums, get one of them on Spotify, play about 6 gigs (I even was paid in beer for one of them!), sell Â£30 worth of digital-format music to you lovely people, and meet <a href="http://www.superpowerless.co.uk/">some</a> <a href="http://btype.tumblr.com/">other</a> <a href="http://benforbes.com/">like-minded</a> <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">musicians</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I <strong>stopped</strong>. <a href="http://huddle.com">Work</a> happened, Reddit distracted me and I generally lost my way a bit on the music front.</p>
<p>This blog post, and the website which goes with it, is the official indication that I am in fact, back in the game.</p>
<p>Some people think it&#8217;s a bit old-fashioned, Internet, for a musician to have an official website since there are so many places where I can set up a page. To those people I say, &#8220;get off my lawn you young hooligans, I do what I want.&#8221; Nevertheless, I have set up a <a href="http://danplusadd.bandcamp.com">bandcamp page</a>, I have my second album, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/2t5pxCYilQExlopyymFI2U">Matters of Great Importance, on Spotify</a> and obviously there&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/danplusadd">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/danplusadd">Facebook</a>. These links are useful, because it means I can spam you regardless of to which side of the epic <strong>Battle for the Internet</strong> between all the sites &#8211; which I definitely did not just make up right now &#8211; you have pledged your alliegance. I&#8217;m gonna update <strong>at least</strong> Twitter and Facebook whenever I release a new song.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Internet, I missed you. So did my guitar. Watch this page for more. A new song is approaching.</p>
<p>Dan</p>
